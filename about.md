# About

Endpoint metadata is reloaded at build time with the help of several data loaders. Please check the README for more information on how each metric is calculated.

## Adding a new endpoint

Add known LDES endpoints to `urls.txt`, one per line with the correct protocol (e.g. https://). On each line, provide the endpoint url followed by the title (description of the endpoint) separated by a comma e.g.

```
https://example.com/endpoint1,Endpoint 1
```

- For telraam: https://telraam.net/#9/51.0470/3.7206, cannot identify where the LDES is located, and if it is public.
